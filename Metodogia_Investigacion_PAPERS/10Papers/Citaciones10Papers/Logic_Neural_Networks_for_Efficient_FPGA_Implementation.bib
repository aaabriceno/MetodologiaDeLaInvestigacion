	abstract = {Logic Neural Networks (LNNs) represent a new paradigm for implementing neural networks in hardware devices such as Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). These network architectures exhibit unique attributes that can leverage the inherent parallelism of FPGAs, enabling the development of networks characterized by low power consumption and fast inference capabilities. Despite their potential advantages, the relative novelty of LNNs poses a challenge, as there are currently no established guidelines for defining their architectures. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of LNNs, aiming to address the existing gap in understanding and guide decision-making during the design phase. Through systematic experimentation and analysis, we explore various aspects of logic networks, including their impact on inference time, power consumption, and overall simplicity. The findings derived from these experiments provide valuable insights for the creation of improved networks, thereby paving the way for further advancements in this field.},
