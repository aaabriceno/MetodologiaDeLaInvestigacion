	abstract = {Early identiﬁcation of security issues in software development is vital to minimize their unanticipated impacts. Code review is a widely used manual analysis method that aims to uncover security issues along with other coding issues in software projects. While some studies suggest that automated static application security testing tools (SASTs) could enhance security issue identiﬁcation, there is limited understanding of SAST’s practical eﬀectiveness in supporting secure code review. Moreover, most SAST studies rely on synthetic or fully vulnerable versions of the subject program, which may not accurately represent real-world code changes in the code review process.},
